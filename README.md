# diy-pulse-ox

In which I make a pulse-oximeter from Sparkfun and Arduino parts.

For the full details and pictures, [check out my blog post](https://johnkeefe.net/building-a-pulse-oximeter).

This uses a Sparkfun "pulse oximeter" development board, and the [page for using this product](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-pulse-oximeter-and-heart-rate-monitor-hookup-guide) warns in red letters that "**this device is not intended to diagnose or treat any conditions**." I offer the same caution if you're tempted to build one.
